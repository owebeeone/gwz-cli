Create a workspace or initialize one from source URLs.

A GWZ workspace is a local directory that owns a tracked `gwz.conf/` metadata
directory. `gwz.conf/gwz.yml` describes the workspace and its repository
members. `gwz.conf/gwz.lock.yml` records the exact revisions that make the
workspace reproducible.

Running `gwz init` with no URLs creates an empty workspace at `--root` or the
current directory. Passing one or more URLs creates the workspace and adds those
repositories as initial members, materialized from their heads.";
